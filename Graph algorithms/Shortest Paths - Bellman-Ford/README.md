###Description

An implementation of a Bellman-Ford's approach for finding shortest path from source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. This implementation detects negative cycles. 

###Usage

####Input

<b>n, m, src</b> - number of vertices and number of edges respectively, followed by the starting vertex.<br>
Then m lines, each line describing an undirected edge (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>) with weight <b>c</b>. <br> 

However it is easy to change that implementation to accept direct edges.

Vertices starts with 0.

####Output

An array <b>dist</b> containing distance from source vertex to all other vertices (i.e. <b>dist[a]</b> is equal to the distance between vertex <b>src</b> and vertex <b>a</b>).

####Additional comments

<b>MAXN</b> - maximal number of vertices. <br>
<b>INF</b>  - any big enough number. <br>
