###Description

An implementation of a Breadth First approach for searching the graph.

###Usage

####Input

<b>n, m, src</b> - number of vertices and number of edges respectively, followed by starting vertex. <br>
Then m lines, each line describing an undirected edge (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>). <br> 

However it is easy to change the implementation for the direct edges. 

####Output

An array <b>dist</b> containing unit distance from source to all of vertices (i.e. <b>dist[c]</b> is equal to unit distance from the source vertex to vertex <b>c</b>). If no path exists, the distance is equal to INF.

####Additional comments

<b>MAXN</b> - maximal number of vertices. <br>
<b>INF</b> - some big enough number. <br>
